## What does this repository contain?

Since I am currently on job search, this repo will contain my personal homepage https://markuswagner.cloud
So it will be a combination of following tools:

1. The Portfolio (This is currently hosted in the root directory via [Potion](https://potion.so/)) amd build with [Notion](https://notion.so)
2. A connected datasource to Notion, so I dont need to develop this twice
3. A Blog powered by VuePress and the [Theme "Hope"](https://vuepress-theme-hope.github.io/v2/)
4. All hosted here on GitHub Pages, build via Actions and the domain is bought on [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
