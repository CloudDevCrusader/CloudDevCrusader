## Introduction

Hello fellow Devolpment Friends! This my new account, since my old one got really messy, it was already 8 years old. So I decided now to open up this GitHub Account and configure it clean like the [old one "djdiox"](https://github.com/djdiox). So now here we go, nice clean & informative. Enjoy!

### Who am I?

I am a 29 year old Full Stack Developer from Stuttgart, Germany. Working now since 10 years in IT and for the last 4,5 years I specialized my self in Cloud Development

> I am currently looking for a new job! Are you interested in getting to know me? Just mail me vial [jobsearch@markuswagner.dev](mailto:jobsearch@markuswagner.dev?subject=I%20might%20have%20an%20interesting%20position%20for%20you%20%3A)&body=I%20am%20very%20pleased%20to%20hear%20from%20you!%20Don't%20hesitate%20to%20ask%20me%20anything!)


Currently I am mostly doing cloud projects with my company, but also working as a freelancer for a various of customer via fiverr usw. I was already certified as a Solutions Architect on AWS and really experienced in Frontend- *and* Backend Development. 
I work as a consultant, which means I do not only get tasks for coding. The projects begins much earlier: Finding problems or improvements in the business cases from my customer. Once identifed, I decide, what tool stack fits the best and is cost-efficent and easy to use.

### Quick Tools Overview:

- [Notion](https://notion.so)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- JavaScript, JSON and Markdown are my most used languages at the moment
- Frontend: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- Backend: [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) [Serverless (e.g. Lambda)](https://www.serverless.com/) [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) also [ASP.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/apis?ranMID=46128&ranEAID=wizKxmN8no4&ranSiteID=wizKxmN8no4-aZgHzLIeHlPndc.dzkjOcg&epi=wizKxmN8no4-aZgHzLIeHlPndc.dzkjOcg&irgwc=1&OCID=AID2200057_aff_7794_1243925&tduid=%28ir__oakxw0o069kfbxsddagjqdyfzn2xcmwanfwxn0g600%29%287794%29%281243925%29%28wizKxmN8no4-aZgHzLIeHlPndc.dzkjOcg%29%28%29&irclickid=_oakxw0o069kfbxsddagjqdyfzn2xcmwanfwxn0g600)
- Mostly i would use the programming language which fits best, since the mechanism are mostly in every language the same, I can easily teach myself any language pretty fast ;) 
- Linux / macOS / Windows
- Desktop / Laptop


## What does this repository contain?

Since I am currently on job search, this repo will contain my personal homepage https://markuswagner.dev
So it will be a combination of following tools:

1. The Portfolio (This is currently hosted in the root directory via [Potion](https://potion.so/)) amd build with [Notion](https://notion.so)
2. A connected datasource to Notion, so I dont need to develop this twice
3. A Blog powered by VuePress and the [Theme "Hope"](https://vuepress-theme-hope.github.io/v2/)
4. All hosted here on GitHub Pages, build via Actions and the domain is bought on [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
